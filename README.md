Mary's Appointment App with Dropdowns and Timepickers
Its been pushed to Heroku

## Things to Conquer
* ~~Delete Button Controversy~~
    * ~~It mysteriously was routing to edit even though url pointed to delete~~
* Blank out back dates
* Possibly add a visible calendar where the appointments are loaded
* ~~Fill in ALL fields on the edit screen~~
* Transfer the Location Radio Dial information
* ~~Clear the 'Nones' from the Onsite fields~~
* Make back to Appts list pop up only on search page
